### Slide 1 (Direct comparison of Pop. and rides)
The first slide shows the total number of rides in New York City in the Month of August. It also shows a bar graph directly comparing the populations of New York and Des Moines. Admittedly, the graph is a little scary because of the immense difference. However, the next slide aims to ease some of the initial fears. 
### Slide 2 (10 year population growth)
The second slide shows the change in population over 10 years as a decimal. Clearly, Des Moines is a very fast growing city which is a strong positive for potentially starting a business there. 
### Slide 3 (Tourism numbers)
The third slide is a table that shows data regarding tourism numbers for the two cities. Obviously New York gets more annual tourists than Des Moines, but for a city with the population of only 200,000, Des Moines' tourism numbers are booming. Bike rental is a great way to explore the city and this business would benefit greatly from more visitors. 
### Slide 4 (Average Annual Rainfall)
The fourth slide shows that even though their temperatures are very similar, Des Moines gets less rain on average than New York City. When it rains, potential customers are less likely to travel by bike, so lower rainfall levels is another positive for Des Moines.
